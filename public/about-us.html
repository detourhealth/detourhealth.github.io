									<h2>Our Mission</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Detour Health is a community of engineers, physicians, and healthtech industry professionals that aim to connect you to who’s who in the healthcare innovation field and to educate you. <br><br>First and foremost, we aim to accessible and collaborative. However, we also aim to help you discover what healthcare innovation means to you, and to help you find your path in the healthcare innovation field - whether it’s in the context of redesigning a piece of equipment to help one patient, or if it’s an ambition to bring a medical device idea from ideation to IPO or acquisition. </p>

									<h2>Our Vision</h2>
								</header>
								<p>We envision Detour Health as an accessible, collaborative community for healthcare innovation; to this extent, we offer regular podcast and newsletter content to give our community something to share and to learn from together. Just as importantly, we offer a means for healthcare workers, industry professionals, and technical experts like engineers to connect and to collaborate in a centralised fashion. Whether you’re just starting or have a full fledged idea or project, you’ll be able to find whoever you need to bring your project to light.<br><br>We aim to collaborate with our colleagues in healthcare, industry, and technical development, and as such, we will gladly direct groups who grow within our community to resources which we cannot offer. However, we are always open to feedback and are willing to co-develop resources to best serve our collaborative, interdisciplinary community in their healthcare innovation ambitions.</p>
